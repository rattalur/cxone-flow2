\chapter{Distributed Resolver Agents}\label{sec:resolver-agents}

\section{Overview}

Executing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scans in \cxone will gather results
by analyzing packages found in the dependency tree for the code submitted for scan.  
The \cxone SCA scan first obtains a dependency tree, then performs an analysis
of the packages found in the dependency tree. The dependency
tree is obtained by executing the same build tools normally used to develop and produce a
distributable software package.  This execution is performed using two methods: server-side 
dependency tree resolution and client-side dependency tree resolution with \scaresolver.

The purpose of the distributed resolver agent configuration with \cxoneflow is to execute a
client-side dependency tree resolution in response to a source control event.  The \cxone
\intlink{sec:overview}{scan workflow} introduces the concept of a deferred scan which delegates
a scan with \scaresolver to an appropriate distributed resolver agent instance.  The selection of
the distributed resolver agent instance is performed through a tag configuration.

The basic workflow used by \cxoneflow with distributed resolver agents is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The SCM event is received by \cxoneflow.  If the event \intlink{sec:overview}{qualifies to invoke} a scan and
    the \intlink{sec:resolver-elements}{resolver elements} in the \cxoneflow configuration exist, \cxoneflow attempts to select
    a distributed resolver agent tag. 
  \item The \cxone project is checked for a tag matching the configured \intlink{sec:yaml-resolver-resolver-tag-key}{resolver-tag-key}.
    If the project has a tag with the matching key and the value matches one of the values in the \intlink{sec:yaml-resolver-allowed-agent-tags}{allowed-agent-tags}
    configuration, that value is selected as the distributed resolver agent's tag.
  \item If the \cxone project does not have a tag with the matching \intlink{sec:yaml-resolver-resolver-tag-key}{resolver-tag-key} and
    \intlink{sec:yaml-resolver-default-agent-tag}{default-agent-tag} is configured, the default tag is selected as the the distributed resolver agent's tag.
  \item If a distributed resolver agent tag is selected, a request for a resolver scan is sent to distributed resolver agents having the selected tag.  The
    \cxone scan is deferred until the distributed resolver agent finishes a scan.
  \item Upon notification that a distributed resolver agent has finished the resolver scan, a \cxone scan is invoked.  A tag is added to the scan
    with the key value configured in the \intlink{sec:yaml-resolver-resolver-tag-key}{resolver-tag-key} element that indicates \textbf{success} or
    \textbf{failure} of the distributed resolver agent scan.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Server-Side Dependency Tree Resolution}

The dependency analysis for the code submitted to \cxone is performed
in the server-side \cxone environment by executing the package managers that match the composition of the code
under scan.  This generally works sufficiently when the code references only publicly-available, open-source
packages and is compatible with the package manager tooling installed in the \cxone environment.  

Not all software is composed of only publicly available packages nor does it always use package manager tooling
that is compatible with those installed in the \cxone environment.  Incompatibilities usually manifest
when some of the following issues are observed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The dependency tree is incomplete when software references a private package repository.
  \item The dependency tree is incomplete when the code under scan is incompatible with the 
  package manager tools installed in the \cxone environment.
\end{itemize}

If the server-side dependency resolution is not producing accurate results, the general solution is to
perform a client-side dependency tree resolution with \scaresolver. 

\subsection{Client-Side Dependency Tree Resolution with \scaresolvertext}

The \scaresolver is typically scripted to execute in
a pipeline prior to the scan submission to \cxone.  This performs the dependency resolution
in the same environment as the code builds, which will generally resolve any tooling compatibility or network connection
problems.  

Since \cxoneflow is primarily driven by asynchronous web hook events and does not invoke a pipeline
where dependency resolution can be scripted, the distributed resolver agents can perform the dependency resolution using
\scaresolver. The diagram in Figure \ref{fig:resolver-agent-diagram} shows a typical deployment of the resolver agent.  


The resolver agent is deployed such that it can execute the same build tooling as is executed during the build
in a CI/CD pipeline. The \cxoneflow server delegates \scaresolver execution to the resolver agent to perform the dependency tree
resolution; this technique is similar to how a CI/CD pipeline delegates build script execution to a system with the correct
build environment.  The build execution is sometimes performed on a self-hosted "runner" agent or executed using a container with a specified tag. 

This execution delegation technique typically results in execution of the build tools that are appropriately
configured for the normal build.  The typical CI/CD pipeline runner will also have the correct network connection paths
needed to communicate to private package repositories.

\section{Distributed Resolver Security Considerations}\label{sec:dist-resolver-security-considerations}

Performing code builds, as is typically performed in a CI/CD pipeline, often includes
a bit of risk in that a build requires the execution of scripting.  There are often
controls in place to prevent anyone other than trusted authors from authoring those scripts.
As part of the scripts, there are often sensitive values exposed to the build script
for purposes of executing the build.

The use of distributed resolver agents involves some of the same risks as those that exist in
CI/CD pipeline builds.  To acquire a dependency tree of a project, the build tools
need to execute against the build definition to minimally produce the dependency
tree that is captured for the scan.  This action in itself can cause code to execute
as part of how the build definition is used by the tooling.  Some build tools allow
the dependencies themselves to execute code as part of the dependency resolution.
These dependencies, in some cases, can land malware in or exfiltrate data from the
environment where the dependency tree is compiled.

The \cxoneflow endpoint server itself does not invoke the build tools; this action is
delegated to the distributed resolver agents.  However, a required step of the
distributed resolver agent is to obtain a clone of the code for scanning.  To facilitate this,
the \cxoneflow endpoint server does send encoded SCM credentials to authorized
distributed resolver agents.  Section \ref{sec:resolver-agent-security} has more details
about security considerations for the distributed resolver agent.

Since the purpose of the resolver scan is to detect vulnerable and malicious packages,
it should be anticipated that malicious packages may be inadvertently referenced
by developers.  While the deployment recommendations of the distributed resolver agents
will help minimize exposure, the following security recommendations should be considered
as part of deployment of \cxoneflow with distributed resolver agents:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use SSL for all message queue connections.
  \item Use SSL connections for delivering SCM events to the \cxoneflow endpoints.
  \item Isolate the distributed resolver agent either through installing on physically isolated machines or
  using OS permissions to isolate the distributed resolver agent runtime.
  \item Configure distributed resolver agents to execute build tools inside containers to isolate the build runtime from
  the distributed resolver agent runtime.
  \item If a scan detects a malware package, rotate all credentials used by \cxoneflow and distributed resolver agents
  after the malware is removed from the source code.
\end{itemize}
